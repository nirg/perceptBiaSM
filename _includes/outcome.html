                    The outcome of this workshop will be a position paper that frames research on social media systems and perceptual bias with respect to four research questions, given below.

                        <li>How do social media systems impact perceptual biases and how do the biases shape social media systems?</li>
                        <li>How can social media data be used to complement existing methodologies (e.g. survey, lab experiments) for measuring specific perceptual biases?</li>
                        <li>How can social media platforms be designed to reduce bias, if possible, in cases where it is undesirable?</li>
