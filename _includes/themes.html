                    The outcome of this workshop will be a position paper that frames research on social media systems and perceptual bias with respect to four themes and research questions:

                        <li><b>What are the key perceptual biases (e.g. stereotypes, ideologies, expectations) that impact social media systems?</b><br>
                        <p class="small">
    We seek a listing and categorization of the types of perceptual biases that impact, or are impacted by, social media systems.  We are interested in perceptual biases at the individual level (e.g. expectation violations, stereotypes, homophily, confirmation bias etc.), group level (e.g. groupthink, social desirability, in-group favoritism, naive realism, etc.), system-level (e.g. algorithmic bias, hiring biases) and beyond.</p></li>
                        <li><b>How do social media systems impact perceptual biases and how do the biases shape social media systems?</b><br>
                        <p class="small">
    We would like to examine perceptual biases from three different directions: how biases shape behavior on social media, how the behavior of others as reflected on social media shape our biases, and what the role of social systems in impacting this relationship is. For example, confirmation bias makes people seek out and follow information sources that confirm their beliefs, which, in turn, leads recommendation systems to recommend similar articles to their friends and furthers the construction of echo chambers. This theme calls for both empirical examples of the mechanisms behind perceptual biases and theoretical characterizations of such processes.</p></li>
                        <li><b>How can social media data be used to complement existing methodologies (e.g. survey, lab experiments) for measuring specific perceptual biases?</b><br>
                        <p class="small">
    The wide adoption of social media presents new opportunities for measuring existing biases, their formation, the underlying forces behind them. However, the methodologies for studying perceptual biases through social media data are still commencing. On the one hand, traditional research methods such as surveys or randomized experiments that have been the gold standard for measuring these biases are criticized for issues with reproducibility, ability generalize, and interference with the biases being measured (e.g. social desirability biases). On the other hand, methods that use large observational datasets are often shadowed by issues of representativeness, incomplete measurement, and applicability to other systems. Therefore, topics of interest include (but are not limited to): methodologies for measuring biases of individuals online, techniques for quantifying how biases impact online behavior, cautionary notes about using online data to measure particular forms of perception, and social theory that might benefit the construction of computational models.</p></li>
                        <li><b>How can social media platforms be designed to reduce bias, if possible, in cases where it is undesirable?</b><br>
                        <p class="small">
    Not all perceptual biases should be targeted for reduction (positivity bias, for example), nor are all perceptual biases equally susceptible to change.  The first part of this theme considers what kinds of perceptual biases we might be interested in reducing (e.g. intergroup favoritism) and how susceptible they actually are to change (e.g. research suggests that certain "sacred values" are almost impervious to change).  However, for those biases that technology can and should be designed to reduce, there are important open questions about how best to progress.  Existing work or future projects aimed at this goal are of interest.
